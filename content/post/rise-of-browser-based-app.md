The release of [atom](https://www.atom.io) Editor and followed with the release of facebook's [Nuclide](https://www.nuclide.io) and also the new [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) made me think that Browser based app is a very powerful platform, who knows maybe next time a true native office suite app, or a multimedia app could build based on that, since Nuclide and Visual Studio Code is an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that have tons of functionality.


The framework that is used to build those Apps is [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) and it is created by [Github](https://github.com), based on the [Github page](https://github.com/atom/electron) for Electron: The Electron framework lets you write cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is based on io.js and Chromium.
