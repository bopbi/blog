I think in order to survive in the IT business we must always open to a new technology (programming language, stack, framework, lib, etc)

and what i am currently interested is:

- [Angular 2](http://www.angular.io) a new approach to use component based rather than MVC, and also to use TypeScript i really rocks.
- [Go](http://www.golanr.org) still got my attention with the performance related story, the concurrency, and story from the startup that used it.
- [RxJava](http://reactivex.io/) a library to manage the streams of data/event asynchronously, at first i got interested about it implementation in [Android](http://android.com) platform with the [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) lib.
- [C](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/) well i have to admit my interest with this programming language is driven by lack of Operating System knowledge

and my next target to learn is:

- [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/), their idea of scaling a db, and make it survivable is very good, basically they provide a simple way to make a cluster db.

Unfortunately i haven't yet involved in a project that use the above (list current/next target to learn), need to spare some time to learn about it then.
