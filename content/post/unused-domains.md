I have to admit that got seduced by the dreams of the startup.

The flow is always like this:

- Suddenly have an (maybe) great idea,
- then think about how it works (how the service / app will do)
- how the UI look
- etc.

But in the end i kinda too lazy to code it (a lot of excussed / no time / etc. Finaly i ended with many unused domain

Here are the list:

- [kulinr.com](http://kulinr.com) my first startup idea, to create an app for culinary suggestion, now the search feature is nearly the same with what foursquare have
- [culinr.com](http://culinr.com) a mirror domain for kulinr.com
- [arjunalabs.com](http://arjunalabs.com) a domain for my freelance work, i haven't yet release any app under this name
- [grabwife.com an](http://grabwife.com) idea to match making app, but to use a more personal way rather than post your foto to get a stalker
- [fotokecil.com](http://fotokecil.com) idea of create your kids curated photo, with its own achievement
- [wayangkertas.com](http://wayangkertas.com) this is related with my idea to create a game that have 2D wayang in a 3D world (inspired by parappa the rapper)
